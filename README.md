Repository set up for Assignment 1
My name is Michael.  I'm an avid cyclist and a big dog person.  I have two dogs, a german-shepherd mix and a Shar Pei/Retriever mix, approximately four and five years old respectively.  I'm married, own a house in The Grove, and I bike-commute to work every single day, rain or shine, hot or cold, snow or ice.
